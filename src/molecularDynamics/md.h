/**
 * \brief The main MolecularDynamics object for running MD simulations.
 *
 * The MolecularDynamics class represents the main simulation object used to run Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.
 * It is defined in `src/molecularDynamics/md.h` and can be configured through its constructor to set various
 * parameters for the simulation. The thermostats available (e.g. Nose-Hoover, VelocityScaling) can be found in
 * `src/molecularDynamics/thermostats.h`, and additional sampling tools (e.g. RDF and MSD samplers) in
 * `src/molecularDynamics/samplers.h`.
 *
 * The constructor `MolecularDynamics::MolecularDynamics` initializes the simulation:
 * - It sets up the system based on input parameters such as number of particles, temperature, box size, and number of steps.
 * - It precomputes system properties like volume and density.
 * - It initializes particle velocities according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (mass = 1, hence momentum = velocity).
 * - It calls `MolecularDynamics::latticeInitialization` to place particles on a cubic lattice to avoid overlaps.
 * - It then refines the initial configuration using `MolecularDynamics::gradientDescent` to move towards a local energy minimum.
 *
 * After initialization, the simulation uses the velocity Verlet integrator to propagate the system:
 * - In the velocity Verlet scheme, velocities are updated in half-steps and positions in full steps.
 * - Forces are calculated by `MolecularDynamics::calculateForce`, which implements pairwise Lennard-Jones interactions.
 * - The Lennard-Jones potential models both repulsive ($r^{-12}$) and attractive ($r^{-6}$) interactions, and is combined with a cutoff.
 * - The potential energy, pressure (via the virial), and forces are computed during the force calculation.
 *
 * The equations of motion implemented are for an NVE ensemble:
 * \f[
 * \mathcal{H}(p,q) = \sum_i^N \frac{p_i^2}{2} + \mathcal{U}(q)
 * \f]
 * with
 * \f[
 * \dot{q} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial p}, \quad \dot{p} = -\frac{\partial \mathcal{H}}{\partial q}.
 * \f]
 * Using the velocity Verlet integrator:
 * \f[
 * v(t+\frac{\Delta t}{2}) = v(t) + F(t) \frac{\Delta t}{2}
 * \]
 * \f[
 * q(t+\Delta t) = q(t) + v(t)\Delta t + F(t)\frac{(\Delta t)^2}{2}
 * \]
 * \f[
 * v(t+\Delta t) = v(t+\frac{\Delta t}{2}) + F(t+\Delta t) \frac{\Delta t}{2}
 * \]
 * where \f$F(t) = -\frac{\partial \mathcal{U}}{\partial q}\f$.
 *
 * For equilibration, a `VelocityScaling` thermostat may be used to maintain the input temperature. Although the final runs
 * may be NVE (no thermostat), during initial equilibration the thermostat helps adjust velocities to match the given temperature.
 * Other thermostats, such as Nose-Hoover, may also be used (defined in `thermostats.h`).
 *
 * In addition, the class provides sampling tools to measure properties like RDF and MSD from `samplers.h`, and logging capabilities.
 * Overall, this class provides the main interface to run MD simulations, from initialization, through equilibration and production,
 * to analysis of thermodynamic and structural properties.

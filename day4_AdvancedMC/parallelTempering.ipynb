    "In parallel tempering we consider N systems. In each of these systems we perform a simula-\n",
    "tion in the canonical ensemble, but each system is in a different thermodynamic state. Usually, but\n",
    "not necessarily, these states differ in temperature. In what follows we assume that this is the case.\n",
    "Systems with a sufficiently high temperature pass all barriers in the system. The low-temperature\n",
    "systems, on the other hand, mainly probe the local energy minima. The idea of parallel tempering\n",
    "is to include MC trial moves that attempt to “swap” systems that belong to different thermo-\n",
    "dynamic states, e.g., to swap a high temperature system with a low temperature system. If the\n",
    "temperature difference between the two systems is very large, such a swap has a very low prob-\n",
    "ability of being accepted. This is very similar to particle displacement in ordinary Monte Carlo.\n",
    "If one uses a very large maximum displacement a move has a very low probability of being ac-\n",
    "cepted. The solution to this problem is to use many small steps. In parallel tempering we use\n",
    "intermediate temperatures in a similar way. Instead of making attempts to swap between a low\n",
    "and a high temperature, we swap between systems with a small temperature difference. In prin-\n",
    "ciple the distribution of the position of a particle should be symmetrical. The high-temperature\n",
    "system does show this symmetrical distribution.\n",
    "The total partition function of a system with N canonical subsystems (Q) equals\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Q = \\Pi_{i=1}^{i=N} Q_i$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\beta_i = 1/ (k_B T_i)$. For each of these systems, individual trial moves are performed. After a\n",
    "randomly selected number of trial moves, an attempt is made to exchange configurations. Two\n",
    "systems (i and j, $|i − j| = 1$) are selected at random, the systems are exchanged by choosing\n",

    "\n",
    "$\\frac{acc(o \\to n)}{acc(n \\to o)} = \\exp[(\\beta_i - \\beta_j) \\times (U(x_i) - U(x_j))]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Such trial moves will be accepted when there is enough overlap between the energies of systems\n",
    "i and j. To demonstrate this technique, consider a two-dimensional system of a particle in a Muller-Brown potential. While a particle may have the thermal energy to visit another local minimum than the global minimum, it may not have the energy to overcome the barrier. Coupling this system to a system at a higher temperature that is able to sample the barrier region allows the system to visit all states that it should be able to reach."

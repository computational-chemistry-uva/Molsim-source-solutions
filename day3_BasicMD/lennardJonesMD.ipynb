    "The MD program consists of a main MolecularDynamics object, found in `src/molecularDynamics/md.h`. The object has a constructor, that allows you to set a bunch of different settings that you might want to use in this simulation. Furthermore you will find the thermostats in `src/molecularDynamics/thermostats.h` and some samplers in `src/molecularDynamics/samplers.h`.\n",

    "The `MolecularDynamics` struct has a bunch of different functions. First there is the constructor `MolecularDynamics::MolecularDynamics`, which, from the input settings, sets up the simulation. First it precomputes some properties, like volume and density. Secondly, it initializes the velocities according the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (note that because mass = 1, in this case and therefore momentum = velocity). \n",

    "In MD one propagates the system by integrating the equations of motion. The integrator used for the equations of motion is the velocity Verlet integrator, which is a symplectic integrator.

All particles have interaction with eachother according to the so-called Lennard-Jones potential - which has a repulsive term $r^{-12}$, which can be seen as the Pauli repulsion and an attraction term $r^{-6}$, which is often called the van der Waals term, as the van der Waals interaction also diminishes with $r^{-6}$. \n",

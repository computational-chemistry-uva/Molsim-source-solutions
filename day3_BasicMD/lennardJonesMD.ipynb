    "The MD program consists of a main MolecularDynamics object, found in `src/molecularDynamics/md.h`. The object has a constructor, that allows you to set a bunch of different settings that you might want to use in this simulation.

    "### MolecularDynamics object\n",
    "The `MolecularDynamics` struct has a bunch of different functions. First there is the constructor `MolecularDynamics::MolecularDynamics`, which, from the input settings, sets up the simulation. First it precomputes some properties, like volume and density. Secondly, it initializes the velocities according the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (note that because mass = 1, in this case and therefore momentum = velocity). \n",

    "In MD one propagates the system by integrating the equations of motion. The integrator used for the equations of motion is the velocity Verlet integrator, which is a symplectic integrator. This means that the Hamiltonian is conserved, or, in other words, the drift or error in the ideally constant Hamiltonian is bounded. The Hamiltonian for an NVE system is (settings $m=1$)\n",

It can be nicely combined with computing the potential energy and the virial, which is used in the pressure. All particles have interaction with eachother according to the so-called Lennard-Jones potential - which has a repulsive term $r^{-12}$, which can be seen as the Pauli repulsion and an attraction term $r^{-6}$, which is often called the van der Waals term, as the van der Waals interaction also diminishes with $r^{-6}$. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Thermostats\n",
    "In this tutorial we use just NVE (constant number of particles N, volume V and energy E) simulations. However, during the equilibration the kinetic energy is kept constant. While we do a constant energy simulation, it is preferable to give an input temperature, as this is more natural when doing research. Early on there might still be large shifts in kinetic energy due to the equilibration and therefore we keep it constant, using a `VelocityScaling` thermostat. This thermostat simply rescales the velocities to exactly reproduce the input temperature and therefore does not "

    "In this equation, $E\\left(t\\right)$ is the total energy (kinetic+potential) of the system at time $t$. The program prints the average drift at the end of the run. To prevent drift, the timestep should be reasonably small given the system density. High density leads to larger forces, which lead to larger errors. Test to see how high you can push the timestep before the system starts to diverge. "
